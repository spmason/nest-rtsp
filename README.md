# Nest RTSP Manager

**NEW** Because of community interest, I've created a [Discord](https://discord.gg/Stx427N84n) people to ask questions in a more comfortable format.

Uses Google's [Smart Device Managemement](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access) API's to provide an RTSP feed which can be consumed by other RTSP clients such as VLC, Home Assistant, Frigate etc.

# Before you Start

This project requires that you have a [Device Access Console](https://console.nest.google.com/device-access/) account which may require payment.

# Prelaunch Configuration / Requirements

This project was developed on NodeJS 16.14.0. To attempt to reduce possible issues, the project has been pinned to using NodeJS 16.x.x.
